# TweakJS Framework

# Development
The framework is currently being documented as it is. 
The list below is features in piority; of which will be implemented. Any help will be greatly appreciated. I have tried to refactor the framework to neaten up things and reduce bugs. 
However i have been working blindly in the knowledge that what im doing should work as it did; once current documentation is done tests will be implemented and i will test it in my current projects using the framework to ensure that it still works well.

# Floobits
The floobits branch is the working branch for collaborative work; keeping everyone up to date. To use this branch you must be approved. 

As this uses the floobits collaborative tool, and it is a very experimental branch, code may get lost, so if you are working on important code make sure you are pulled of the development branch and you are not connected to the floobits workspace.

Putting suggestion to floobits, that there should be an option to only be able to connect to a floobits workspace when on a floobits branch. Saving from accidental checkouts which could wipe code in progress.
